I t \nallows group members to gain kn owledge through collaborations \nand in teractions. Nowaday s, most Internet coop erative le arning \nsystems are d esigned to  pro vide studen ts mainly with a \nconvenient online environment to  study theoretical courses  bu t \nrarely w ith a n onlin e environment to  o perate pr actical \ninstruments. Hence, this paper designed a 3D  online cooperative \nlearning s ystem for operating virtual in struments with \ncircuit-measuring function . B y i ntegrating with Virtual R eality, \nRemote Cont rol Pa rameter Tra nsmission and embedded s ystem \ntechniques, this s ystem giv es learners no t only  a cooperative \nlearning env ironment via netwo rking to jointly operate th e 3D \nvirtual instruments (for  ex ample, m ulti-meters, power  supplies  \nand oscilloscopes) but also the f unctions of instant messages and  \n3D puzzles to interact with one another. Therefore, learners can \neffectively improve learning interests and results. \nKeywords: Cooperative learning syst em, embedded system, \nvirtual instruments\n1.Introduction \nIn t he trad itional learn ing, t he learn ing process of th e \nstudents is si milar to  pho tocopy. Th ey catch  th e \nknowledge tra nsferred by teach ers. T he teachers teac h in \none-way. Although the questions and suggestions from the \nstudents a re i mportant, t he influence i s i n o ne-way. T he \nteachers have been acting the models all the time. Starting \nfrom th e pu tting fo rward of th e qu estions, an alysis, \nreasoning to answer, all of  them  are dom inated and  \ndemonstrated by the teachers and the students are passive. \nThey observe and sim ulate th e co ntents taugh t by t he \nteachers and the learning res ults are not good. Under the  \ntraditional learn ing, th e studen ts a re short of cha nce for \ndiscussion, c ommunication an d ar gumentation with \ncolleagues. Therefore, they have no idea on how the others \nconsider on so lving th e same p roblem, h ow th ey can  \nclarify the own views through the interaction with others \nand how t he others organize t he k nowledge and  co ncept \nfrom t he com munication an d a rgumentation. T he \ntraditional l earning bec omes an acc umulation o f \nknowledge. The teache rs a re res ponsible for inc ulcating \nthe results of the evolvement to the students. This learning \nactivity does not only drab but it is not meaningful. \n \nIn general, t here are t here learning m odes, i ncluding \nCompetitive Learni ng, I ndividualistic Learni ng and \nCooperative Learn ing (Hu ang, 1996). In the Co mpetitive \nLearning, t he students com pete for the ac hievement with  \neach other. They pursue the targets that can be achieved by \na few students. Thus, the students may make every effort \nto win, or th ey may g ive u p to tally an d escap e fro m th e \nreality. In  t he Ind ividualistic Learn ing, t he stu dents are \narranged to make effort indepe ndently to ac hieve \nindividual t argets. T he st udents pursue for i ndividual \nbenefits, a nd t hey at tach i mportance to their own e fforts \nand results. They do not  mind the learning a nd \nachievements of  ot her col leagues. In t he C ooperative \nLearning, they must help each other. They discuss, ask and \nanswer questions m utually, and feedback i n groups i n \norder t o achi eve t he i ndividual a nd g roup t argets. T his \ndoes not only be nefit t he i ndividual st udents but al so \nbenefits to the group members (Chen, 1997; Huang, 1996). \nIn the  process of Cooperative Lea rning, all  m embers are  \nbenefited f rom t he gro ups, an d t he l earning usually \nhappens when student are active and collaborate in solving \na problem  in a social envi ronment (Laurillard, 20 02). I n \nfact, recent pedagogical research shows that learning is not \nsimply k nowledge assimilat ed with  t he help  o f a m ore \nknowledgeable person or mediated by a c omputer system, \nbut also jointly constructed through solving problems with \npeers by  a process o f building sha red understanding \n(Scardamalia \u0026 Bereiter, 2003). It is a k ind of life \ncommunity and is a learning trend that is suitable for team  \ncooperation an d inno vation in  t he ex isting h igh-tech \nsociety. \n \nThere is a series of innovative teaching methods applied in \neducational dom ain recently.

The results from \nmany researches (Zhang, 2003; Lin, 2005; Neo, 2006) also \nshow t hat the teaching c ontents s hould interact with \nstudents regardless of the multimedia network teaching or \nthe recent virtual reality auxiliary teaching system in order \nto reac h t he best learning performance. T he c omputer i s \nnot the machine for data analysis only. From the designed \ndigital teaching m aterials, it  does not only prom ote the \ninterests of the learn ers bu t also  i mproves th e learn ing \nefficiency. Furthermore, the learners all over the world can \nuse t he teachi ng m aterials easily through the network. \nMany d omestic and foreign re searchers o n net work \nCooperative L earning wish t o estab lish a more effective \nlearning env ironment throug h th e Internet in ord er to \nimprove t he learning ab ility and p erformance of th e \nstudents (Shi, 2 002; C hen, 2 004; D ong, 2004). T he \nexisting =b e classified  in to th ree typ es acco rding to th e \ntools a nd t echnologies o f design. T he fi rst t ype i s t he \nnetwork C ooperative Lea rning sy stem t hat provides \ndocuments m ainly ( Johnson, 19 94；Maier, 199 4). Th is \ntype of C ooperative Learning system discusses the design \nof t he shared document dat abase a nd t he sy stem \ninfrastructure of t he network C ooperative Learni ng. T he \nsecond type  is the Coopera tive Learning system  that \nprovides video conferencing function. As per the name, it \nis suggested that th e Cooperative Learning system mainly \nprovides the mechanism for the members of the group to \ndiscuss face -to-face on ne twork. The t hird type of \nCooperative Learning sy stem pr ovides vi rtual real ity \nenvironment ( Maier, 1994). T his t ype of C ooperative \nLearning system mainly pro vides a l earning en vironment \nof simulated virtu al reality t o th e members o f the group.  \nHowever, m ost o f t he e xisting network C ooperative \nLearning sy stem a conve nient network e nvironment f or \nthe stud ents t o con duct online Cooperati ve Le arning of \ntheoretical cou rses. It  is rarely t o discuss how the \nCooperative Learning environment of operation training of \nonline-simulated i nstruments and th e circu it cu rrent \nmeasurement can be established.  \n \nThis p aper has p roposed a Web-based Co operative \nLearning system for remote operation 3D virtual electronic \ninstruments wi th circu it-measuring fun ction. The system \ndoes not only provide the cooperative operation practice of \nsimulated instruments on network for the learners, it also \nimproves the interests of th e learners in practical courses \nand the learning performance through the system functions \nincluding real time text chatting and discussion, and actual \ncircuit m easurement. The c hapters of th is article also  \ninclude embedded system and applications, virtual reality, \nand system infrastructure implementation, the Cooperative \nLearning of virtual i nstruments o peration a nd ci rcuit \nmeasurement, and conclusions. \n2. Embedded System and Applications \nThe \"Em bedded system \" integrates the  application of \ninformation soft ware a nd hardware. T he application o f \nembedded system can be f ound everywhere, including the \nlife facilities su ch as m obile p hone, electric to y and  \nvideo-audio i nstrument, an d t ransportation sy stem an d \nautomation in facto ries. The trend  of the fun ctions of \ncommon em bedded syste ms is sim plification. The \nsoftware and hardware only include the modules required \nfor s pecific functions . T he pe ripheral products from \ndifferent manufacturers are combined to become an intact \nembedded syste m according to the provide d Intelligence \nProperty (IP). Comparing with the common computers, the \nbuilding cost can be reduced significantly. Besides, due to \nthe domain of t he a pplication, m ost o f t hem i nclude t he \ncharacteristics of m iniaturization a nd l ow-power \nconsumption. Since the system only includes  the specific \nfunctions, th e design of th e system will b e op timized to  \nensure the stability of the system (Kao, 2007). \n \n2.1 Development Approach of Embedded System \nSince the embedde d syste m is devel oped for s pecific \nfunctions, t he de veloping t ools i nclude I n-Circuit \nEmulator (I CE), Development B oard, I ntegrated \nDevelopment En vironment (I DE) and c ompiler \n(Microtime Computer, 2004). The Development Board is \nthe design sample provided by the hardware manufacturers. \nThe debugging m echanism in th e ce ntral processing unit \nof the In-Circuit together with the pre-set messages of the \ncompiler can  si mulate th e p rogram ru nning on t he \nhardware. T he p roduct de velopers m ay refe r t o thei r \ncircuit desi gn an d i ntegrate to the corresponding \ndeveloping e nvironment. Therefore, m ost of t he \nDevelopment Boards have been built with many peripheral \nfunction m odules suc h as network car d, seven-segment \ndisplay, parallel po rt, LED and  dip switch , for th e \nconvenient of pr oduct develo pment and sp eedup th e \nproduct  development cy cle. The  ap plication i ntegrating \nthe d evelopment env ironment an d co mplier refer to  th e \ndevelopment s oftware on t he per sonal c omputer of  t he \ndeveloper. T herefore, t he system devel opers m ay desi gn \nthe working platforms and the corresponding applications \nof t he em bedded sy stem on the p ersonal c omputer, a nd \ncomplete the compiling. Through the parallel port or serial \nport, the corresponding software can be embedded to the \ntarget board and the cross-platform development process is \nfinished. Since th e co mmon lo w-cost m ultimeter can not \ncommunicate wi th c omputer, t his st udy has m ade use  of \nlow-cost 8-bit 89c51 chip to develop Embedded RS-2332 \nModule t o cap ture t he data sh own on t he p anel of  t he\n\nIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 7, Issue 1, No. 3, January 2010 \nISSN (Online): 1694-0784 \nISSN (Print): 1694-0814 \n10\n \nmultimeter and  tran sfer it to  th e co mputer ( as show n in  \nFigure 1). \n \n \nFigure 1 Embedded RS-232 module \n2.2 Embedded RS-232 Module \nSince m ost of the l ow-cost multimeters us ed by stude nts \ndo not include the serial communication function with the \ncomputer, this study makes use of 8-bit 89C51 single chip \nto im plement an  Em bedded RS-23 2 Modu le. It is t hen \nintegrated with the  low-c ost multimeter to replace t he \nhigh-cost multimeter. The 89C51 single chip includes the \nfollowing advantages: (1) the  program is easy to learn (2) \nlow-cost (3) sim ple cir cuit (4 ) small size. The \ninfrastructure of the single chip is shown in Figure 2. The \ncorresponding specification is as follows: \n(1) CPU: the automatic controlled high performance 8-bit \nCPU is used to im plement th e whole operatio n of the \ncomputer. \n(2) Pr ogram m emory: the ROM  or EPROM is use d t o \nstore the program and the constant numbers . Different \nmemories \n   have  different codes. \n(3) Data memory: the RAM is used to store the data that is \ndynamic during the running of the program. The data can \nbe \n   accessed in the m emory with the CPU. The data will \ndisappear if the power is off.  \n(4) Oscillator: An  oscillator is in cluded in  t he MCS-51 \nseries single chip. It will produce the clock for the who le \nsystem if  \n   it is connected with a quartz crystal. \n(5) I/O pins: there are 32 input / output pins to use. \n(6) Tim er / Co unter: t he comman ds are used to set th e \n16-bit Timer or 16-byte Counter. \n \n \nFigure 2 89C51 block diagram \n2.3Embedded Broker \nAs the network technology and applications are developed \nrapidly, l arge am ount o f s ervers for different net work \nservices are built. They include file server, web server and \nEmail server. These servers are bu ilt on high-end servers. \nAccording t o th e fun ctions built by the users, t hese \npowerful servers become the specific function servers. The \nhardware i s very c omplicated an d e xpensive, an d i t \nincreases the building cost of the system directly. To build \nthe network server by the embedded system, the relevant \nfunctions can be enhanced according to the requirement of \nthe service. For example, the files op erating performance \nand the space of the hard disks of the file server should be \nincreased but the relatively low performance of CPU ca n \nbe used. T his can re duce the cost effectively and i ncrease \nthe co mpetitiveness. Th is p aper has adopted AR M7 \ndevelopment boa rd (as shown i n Fi gure 3) t o develop \nembedded Broker to replace the expensive server. \n \nFigure 3 ARM7TDMI development board \n3. Application of Virtual Reality Technology \nThe Virtual Reality (VR) is th e term  fo r scien ce and  \ntechnology d omain. The v irtual reality includes many \ncomponents s uch as vision, heari ng, a nd eve n se nse of \ntouch and sense of smell. The users can determine the path \nfor browsing the information freely in  th e virtual reality.\n\nIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 7, Issue 1, No. 3, January 2010 \nISSN (Online): 1694-0784 \nISSN (Print): 1694-0814 \n11\n \nTherefore, the virtual reality can  be regarded as an  intact \nmultimedia system. The major characteristics of the virtual \nreality syste m are th e i nteraction and  t he real tim e \nresponse. When it is ap plied on application, the users can \noperate t he c omputers free ly. They  ca n obse rve t he \nproducts in  an y ang le and p osition. Th e v irtual reality  \ntechnology makes use of  the computer drawing or im age \nsynthetic techn ology tog ether with t he virtual reality \nconstructed by sound processing, sense of touch and sense \nof taste. In this virtual world, the 3D simulated object can \nbe our famous things, or something that we cannot see, or \na simulated imagined space. Virtual reality is an integrated \ntechnology in o rder to  provide a h igher lev el of \nman-machine in terface (K ao, 200 7). Dong  (2004) has \nproposed three im portant topics fo r virtual reality. They \nare immersio n, in teraction an d im agination (3I). Th ese \nthree topics are explained respectively as follows: \n   (1 ) Immersion: \n   The users can feel the scene of virtual reality directly \nproduced by  computer. Th e di splay sy stem pro vides a \nsimulated an d Fi rst-person vi rtual world a nd sce ne. \nBesides, i t can be c ontrolled by  t he users di rectly. Th e \nusers can really \"immerse\" in the world of virtual reality. \n   (2 ) Interaction \n   The users interact with the objects in the virtual reality \nworld. For e xample, t he users ca n wal k in t he virtual \nworld, or wear the glove to catch the objects in the virtual \nworld, or even interact with other users in the same virtual \nworld. \n   (3 ) Imagination: \n   The v irtual reality p rovides im agining sp ace t o t he \nusers. If th e virtu al reality tech nology is applied in th e \ninteracting environment of the virtual group, then multiply \nusers ca n rem ote l ogon simultaneously, a nd sh are a nd \ninteract in the same space, an d meet the characteristics of \nvirtual reality. Th is m ust b ring better efficien cy on  \ninteraction and  co mmunication app roach to th e virtual \ngroup. The users can talk and interact as if t hey are in t he \nreal w orld. T he a pplication an d d evelopment of virtual \nreality tech nology on d ifferent professional do mains are \nincreasing gradually. On e o f the reasons is that t he \nfunction of the software of virtual reality is enhanced. It is \nmore important that the cost for virtual reality on p ersonal \ncomputer (PC) is relatively low and it is widely accepted \nby al l t rades and professions. T he 3 D Webmaster an d \nVirtools De v 3.0 ha ve been ad opted i n t his st udy t o \ndevelop the relevant virtual instruments. \n \nThe 3D Webmaster do es not only pro vide th e ed iting \nfunction for the 3D virtual object but it can also transform \nthe DX F or  VRML2.0 for mat to  ot her 3 D fo rmat. It can \nalso ex port t o VR ML2.0 format and t he audi o fi le i s \nmainly in wav fo rmat. The Direct 3D is su pported and Z \nbuffer is used for image processing so that the images look \nreal and smooth. The system has no strict limitation to the \nhardware and it supports most of the peripheral devices of \nvirtual reality. In add ition, th e SDK (Sup erscape \nDevelopers Kit) is applicable to compiling to the Dynamic \nLinking Libraries (.d ll file) so  t hat it can plug-in to th e \nvirtual sce ne and de velop t he own drivers. Th e vi rtual \nreality tool can d evelop online virtual reality and multiple \nusers’ conn ections on network. It can also pro cess \ndynamic data link with other applications for information \nsharing. It provides an intact virtual scene to the users and \nthey can browse the virtual scene from network after they \nhave i nstalled Activ eX on the browser. This so ftware \nincludes di fferent e diting t ools, suc h as  model edi tor, \nimage editor, 3D scene a nd 3D  virtual ob ject ed itor. In  \norder to increase the control of the 3D virtual object and \nflexibility of the interactive design of the 3D virtual object, \nthe 3D Webmaster provides Superscape Control Language \n(SCL), which is sim ilar to prog ramming lang uage C . \nTherefore, the users can write with the control language in \nthe virtual sc ene desi gned by t hemselves ( Superscape, \n1996) as shown in Figure 4. \n \n \nFigure 4 SCL program editor of 3D Webmaster \n4. System Infrastructure and Implementation \nThe net work technology is devel oped rapi dly. For \nexample, t he web l anguage st arts fr om HTML, SM IL, \nVRML to XML. T he m edia appeare d starts from  text, \npicture, a nd i mage t o st reaming m edia. T he t ransmission \nchannel starts from modem, ISDN, T1 lease line to ADSL. \nThe c hange c auses t he re volutionary development on  \nteaching method, teaching style and interactive mechanism. \nIn order t o recognize t he c haracteristics of Cooperative \nLearning, the system of this study provides the functions \nincluding group real time discussion, real time interaction, \noperation of 3D virtual electronic instruments that include\n\nIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 7, Issue 1, No. 3, January 2010 \nISSN (Online): 1694-0784 \nISSN (Print): 1694-0814 \n12\n \ntransmission technology of remote control parameters and \ncircuit measurement. \n \n4.1 System infrastructure \nThe functions of t he sy stem are di vided i nto f our m ajor \nparts as shown in Figure 5. \n   (1) C ooperative Lea rning system : the learne rs ca n \ndownload th e installation fil e fro m th e link  of th e portal \nwebsite.

Any \nlearner ca n operate the own m ultimeter to  progress \ncooperative practice. As shown in Figure 6, when the user \nsends t he co ntrol c ommand (o r get t he data fr om ci rcuit \nmeasurement) to th e 3D v irtual i nstrument thro ugh t he \nOperating Interface, it will be determined and processe d \nby the embedded control program and a control parameter \nwill be obtained. Then with th e remote control parameter \ntransmission t echnology, t he em bedded B roker t ransmits \nthe control parameter to other learners of the same group \nso that the 3D virtual instruments of the learning partners \ncan be u pdated simultaneously. The detailed transmission \nprocedures of the remote control parameter are as follows: \n  (1) The user sends the control command (or receives the \nmeasured data of t he ci rcuit) on t he Operating Interface. \nThe obtained control parameter will be sent to 3D v irtual \ninstrument first and responded properly in accordance with \nthe control parameter. \n  (2) T he co ntrol parameter i s se nt t o t he em bedded \nTCP/IP control function. \n  (3) T he T CP/IP c ontrol fu nction se nds t he co ntrol \nparameter to the Embedded Broker. \n  (4) Embedded Broker transmits the control parameter to \nthe TCP/IP control functions of other users. \n  (5) Other users will send the received control parameter \nto the embedded control program. \n  (6) The  em bedded c ontrol pr ogram fr om ot her users \nthen se nds t he c ontrol pa rameters t o t he 3D virtual \ninstrument, and it respon ds properly in acco rdance to the  \ncontrol parameter. \n \n \nFigure 6 System operation procedures\n\nIJCSI International Journal of Computer Science Issues, Vol. 7, Issue 1, No. 3, January 2010 \nISSN (Online): 1694-0784 \nISSN (Print): 1694-0814 \n13\n \nIn t his way, t he users can  interact with th e 3D v irtual \ninstruments and  th e d isplay on  th e in struments can  be \nsynchronized among t he u sers i n t he same gro up.

The best result is 5 \npoints, and th e lowest is 1 point. The learners can choo se \nthe situation that they feel from question that they describe. \nThe purpose of this survey is to analyze the actual use with \nco-operative practice syste m, and t hen m ake an \nassessment of learners progress the curriculum.  We use \nonline Assessment methods, and let 40 lea rners fill in t he \nsurvey online after th ey use the c ooperative learni ng \nsystem that is proposed by this research.  From collected \nquestionnaire data, the experts can a nalyze each question \nto related statistical results such as Tab le 1.  From Table \n1, the average grade is between 3.26 to 4.36.

T he proposed C ooperative Le arning syste m \nof 3D virtual instruments with circuit-measuring function \nintegrates with the Virtual re ality technology, em bedded \nsystem technology and the transmission technology of the \nremote co ntrol p arameter. Th e C ooperative Learn ing \nenvironment fo r op eration of instru ments on In ternet is \nestablished co mpletely. It  p rovides the Co operative \nLearning practice of circ uit measurement for the learne rs \nto operate online anytime. Besides, the simulating training \nprovided by  the 3 D vi rtual instruments, and  the online \ngrouped discussion do not only increase the interests of the \nlearners in practice courses and train up their initiative and \ninteraction on  Co operative Learning. T his also dec reases \nthe damage rate of the traditional instruments and reduces \nthe pu rchasing co st of sch ool facilities. Besid es, the \nproposed em bedded B roker wo uld al so provide ser vice \ncapabilities similar to that of a high-end server system, and \nsignificantly reduce the system costs. \nAcknowledgment \nThis paper has bee n s upported i n part by  t he grant \nNSC95-2520-S-212-001-MY3 from th e N ational Science \nCouncil of Taiwan. \n \nReferences \n[1] Chen, S .J.
