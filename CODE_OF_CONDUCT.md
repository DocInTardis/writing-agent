# Code of Conduct

This project follows a contributor-first code of conduct:

1. Be respectful and constructive.
2. Focus on technical issues, not personal attacks.
3. Provide reproducible evidence when reporting bugs.
4. Keep discussions inclusive and professional.
5. Respect maintainers' final moderation decisions.

If you encounter unacceptable behavior, open a private issue or contact the maintainers through the repository security/support channels.
